Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity


The ideal candidate will have a background in a quantitative or technical field and experience working with product teams and making data-driven decisions. You will collaborate with other data scientists, engineers, product managers, product designers, user researchers and education partners to build user-facing experiences to influence the direction of Education!

Our work in education is aimed at ensuring that every student — not just a lucky few — can get an education that's tailored to their individual needs and supports every aspect of their development. We're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there. An example of our work is our partnership with Summit Learning -- a personalized approach to education developed by Summit Public Schools in partnership with learning scientists, researchers, and academics. With Summit Learning, students gain the skills, knowledge and habits to succeed in college and enter adulthood with a clear vision for achieving purpose and wellbeing in life.

Our education data science team is responsible for measuring & evaluating product & program changes. For example, how product impacts student performance on cognitive skills, how schools onboard onto the program or how professional development impacts on onboarding etc. The data science team defines measurements, product metrics, provides product insights through analysis, recommends what to improve and build next, as well as collaborates & communicates with the cross-functional & leadership teams.

You will
Leverage data to understand product, identify areas of opportunity, and execute projects to drive retention & engagement of users on existing features & new pilots.
Collaborate & communicate with product, engineering, data, research, user research, educators and leadership & cross organization teams to execute, inform on current roadmap & influence next roadmap.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.","Brightidea

Data Scientist,$102K-$163K (Glassdoor Est.),"Watchful is a platform that makes machine teaching easy, scalable, and automated. The biggest blocker to delivering ML models in production is no longer the algorithms, but the data (or lack thereof) to train the models. Currently, this has been solved by scaling-out human annotators or labelers and there are a number of managed services that have risen to meet this need. However, for use cases that require specific context (intelligence, legal, cyber, etc.) and/or is based on sensitive or classified data, these solutions are untenable.

Senior Data Scientist (Computer Vision/Natural Language Processing),$110K-$174K (Glassdoor Est.),"Create the model that transforms the mortgage industry


Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction requires our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

In an uncertain real estate market, lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value in title and escrow.

Our streamlined algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company in early 2019 to go from startup to #8 in the country. With a broader nationwide footprint and a huge data set for machine learning, we are poised to transform this industry. We will repurpose the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our document parsing data science team


We're looking for someone who is fired up to automate the manual labor currently associated with ingesting, reviewing, and reconciling the dozens of types of documents that need comprehension during a real estate transaction. This means everything from using advanced optical character recognition techniques to parse scanned documents, to using computer vision to extract the contents, natural language processing to check their validity and action them.

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at Oracle, PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Do you have what it takes?
3-10 years of relevant experience in data science
Excitement about delivering industry-shaking document parsing algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) and/or computer vision (CV) is a requirement
Experience in the above fields is a plus, but not required: we will consider all accomplished persons in any area of data science who are fired up to innovate in the NLP/CV area
Strengths aligned with our needs
E.g. Can you explain how convolutional kernels or attention mechanisms work without making reference to computers?
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
We want to help you do the best work of your life


We believe the most valuable investment we can make — and the greatest boost we can give your career — is an exceptional team of colleagues who are passionate about what we are doing.

We currently offer the following benefits and will continually evolve them with the goal of efficiently attracting, retaining, and leveraging the very highest quality talent.
Our passionate, capable team will always be our #1 benefit
We are proud of the team we have built so far, and we are excited about the team we have yet to add

Data Scientist,$112K-$176K (Glassdoor Est.),"Data Scientist – Global Fishing Watch

General Summary
Global Fishing Watch (GFW) is an independent, international non-profit organization that advances the sustainability and stewardship of the ocean by offering, for free, data and near real-time tracking of commercial fishing activity. We also support new science and research and we engage with governments, management organizations, and NGOs to advance the global dialogue on ocean transparency.

GFW processes a global database of vessel GPS positions, several terabytes in size, and applies machine learning models that infer each vessel’s type and size as well as when they are likely fishing. GFW is now developing new models, both on these GPS positions and on satellite imagery, to fully reveal activity in the world's oceans. These models include object detection from global feeds of satellite radar and optical imagery, and models that infer, based on vessel behavior, illegal activity and unreported catch. We believe that these new models have the potential to dramatically change the way we monitor and manage the world’s oceans.

We are looking for a data scientist to join our research and innovation team to help develop these models. This team works closely with external GFW academic partners to develop models and research, and also with the internal GFW engineering team to scale our methods and put them into production.

The Position
Working closely with the GFW technical teams, the data scientist will help organize data and build models to understand several global datasets that reveal human activity on the world’s oceans. The two key types of data are 1) vessel GPS data and 2) satellite imagery (both optical and radar). A strong ability to work in R or Python is required, as well as abilities to manipulate data in SQL.

The ideal candidate will be excited about working with global data, and will have a high aptitude for learning new techniques. Although it is obviously helpful, we do not expect that you already have a deep knowledge of building models or our key programming languages; we do expect that you have the aptitude to develop these skills and knowledge, and that you are excited about revealing human activity across the global ocean using these tools. Global Fishing Watch values working quickly, innovating, and working collaboratively. Our entire team works remotely, so the ideal candidate is able to manage their own time and be effective with limited daily oversight. Finally, we are passionate about producing research and datasets that will make a difference in how we manage the world’s oceans.

The exact projects the data scientist will focus on will depend on the candidate and other factors at GFW. Possible projects include:
Helping the machine learning engineers build models to identify fishing vessels from satellite and optical imagery -- experience with remote sensing, and especially synthetic aperture radar -- is helpful
Combining vessel detections from imagery with vessel GPS detections to identify vessels that are not broadcasting their locations
Developing models to estimate pollution from ocean going vessels, including noise pollution
Using vessel behavior to identify vessels that have an elevated risk of using forced labor or engaging in other illegal activity
Combing vessel tracking data with animal telemetry data (gps devices that have been attached to sharks and tunas) to build models to identify the likely catch and bycatch of ocean going vessels
Collaborating with the GFW engineering team to automate models.
Engaging with GFW Research Partners to develop these models and publish peer reviewed papers (the GFW Research Program has produced more than 20 academic papers, including many published at top journals)
Write blogs and present public visualizations
Job Requirements

Required Technical Skills

Data Scientist,$95K-$151K (Glassdoor Est.),"Data Scientist – Global Fishing Watch

General Summary
Global Fishing Watch (GFW) is an independent, international non-profit organization that advances the sustainability and stewardship of the ocean by offering, for free, data and near real-time tracking of commercial fishing activity. We also support new science and research and we engage with governments, management organizations, and NGOs to advance the global dialogue on ocean transparency.

GFW processes a global database of vessel GPS positions, several terabytes in size, and applies machine learning models that infer each vessel’s type and size as well as when they are likely fishing. GFW is now developing new models, both on these GPS positions and on satellite imagery, to fully reveal activity in the world's oceans. These models include object detection from global feeds of satellite radar and optical imagery, and models that infer, based on vessel behavior, illegal activity and unreported catch. We believe that these new models have the potential to dramatically change the way we monitor and manage the world’s oceans.

We are looking for a data scientist to join our research and innovation team to help develop these models. This team works closely with external GFW academic partners to develop models and research, and also with the internal GFW engineering team to scale our methods and put them into production.

The Position
Working closely with the GFW technical teams, the data scientist will help organize data and build models to understand several global datasets that reveal human activity on the world’s oceans. The two key types of data are 1) vessel GPS data and 2) satellite imagery (both optical and radar). A strong ability to work in R or Python is required, as well as abilities to manipulate data in SQL.

The ideal candidate will be excited about working with global data, and will have a high aptitude for learning new techniques. Although it is obviously helpful, we do not expect that you already have a deep knowledge of building models or our key programming languages; we do expect that you have the aptitude to develop these skills and knowledge, and that you are excited about revealing human activity across the global ocean using these tools. Global Fishing Watch values working quickly, innovating, and working collaboratively. Our entire team works remotely, so the ideal candidate is able to manage their own time and be effective with limited daily oversight. Finally, we are passionate about producing research and datasets that will make a difference in how we manage the world’s oceans.

The exact projects the data scientist will focus on will depend on the candidate and other factors at GFW. Possible projects include:
Helping the machine learning engineers build models to identify fishing vessels from satellite and optical imagery -- experience with remote sensing, and especially synthetic aperture radar -- is helpful
Combining vessel detections from imagery with vessel GPS detections to identify vessels that are not broadcasting their locations
Developing models to estimate pollution from ocean going vessels, including noise pollution
Using vessel behavior to identify vessels that have an elevated risk of using forced labor or engaging in other illegal activity
Combing vessel tracking data with animal telemetry data (gps devices that have been attached to sharks and tunas) to build models to identify the likely catch and bycatch of ocean going vessels
Collaborating with the GFW engineering team to automate models.
Engaging with GFW Research Partners to develop these models and publish peer reviewed papers (the GFW Research Program has produced more than 20 academic papers, including many published at top journals)
Write blogs and present public visualizations

Senior Data Scientist - Optimization,$117K-$186K (Glassdoor Est.),"ENERGY INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION

The trillion dollar energy industry is undergoing a disruptive transformation. Energy generation is going from centralized to decentralized. Utilities are shifting from vertically integrated power producers and distributors (think PG&E; SoCal Edison) to nimbler energy services providers operating in increasingly deregulated environments. New generation assets are smaller in scale, distributed, powered through renewable sources, and owned by the customers. This shift will lead to over $10 Trillion in new energy investments by 2040. With this dramatic change, energy providers must run their business in new ways. Energy providers of the future will be data-driven, where effective use of data will determine who wins and who loses.

Enter AutoGrid

Lead Senior Data Scientist,$117K-$186K (Glassdoor Est.),"WHO WE ARE:


The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. We help the world's biggest brands reach consumers, and our platform funds content providers and publishers who keep the global Internet free and open for everyone.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale and generates massive amounts of data. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?

Come and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:


* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

* You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.

* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

* You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:


* Lead Senior Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.

* Lead Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.

* Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to own problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.

* Lead Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:


* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role, including leading large and impactful technical projects. You may have an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs.

Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. Machine learning and data science are at our core, and we're building a rare computational team that works closely with our biologists, together fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in biology, just as we don't expect our biologists to be experts in ML. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

About you
Experience. You have 3+ years of real-world experience in data science, software development, or machine learning.
Statistical intuition. You're comfortable dealing with data and forming and testing hypotheses. You have a developed sense of whether analysis lacks rigor and how to improve it.
Tends towards ownership. You do anything necessary to solve the problem at hand.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.

Nice to have
Biological data experience. You bring familiarity with the pitfalls and analytical techniques typically encountered with large biological datasets.
Deep learning intuition. You bring intuition about datasets and experiment structures for deep learning from personal experience.
Scientific background. You have cultural familiarity with scientists and labs from personal experience. You know the language of scientists as well as that of the technical world.

Benefits
Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you

A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Your responsibilities will extend beyond modeling to the entire data science pipeline, including building out our data lake with new sources, performing exploratory analysis, building pipelines to transform data, and providing summary results to business leaders. Our data science efforts are still in their early stages, so you will play a critical role designing our analytics science infrastructure. You will need to take initiative, and be capable of finding solutions where there is no clear path forward.

Your responsibilities will extend beyond modeling to the entire data science pipeline, including building out our data lake with new sources, performing exploratory analysis, building pipelines to transform data, and providing summary results to business leaders. Our data science efforts are still in their early stages, so you will play a critical role designing our analytics science infrastructure. You will need to take initiative, and be capable of finding solutions where there is no clear path forward.
